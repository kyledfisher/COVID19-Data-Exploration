Hello, and welcome to a summary the first training session for bio-group technical
development!  This is an Rmarkdown document that will walk you through what we 
did in the first session on March 30, 2020.

Wtih the myriad statistics of the novel coronavirus pervading most media outlets, 
we opted to examine the data ourselves to obtain a clearer understanding of the 
spread of the disease.  We opted to use the dataset maintained bythe Johns Hopkins 
University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE), for two main
reasons:

    1) They maintain a most excellent data dashboard located here: (https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6) 
    Of particular interest to us is the spatial location data, meaning that we too
    can generate our own maps from these data.  Thanks to Kelsey for the original 
    share!
    
    2) The entire dataset is conveniently located on github 
    (https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19), updated daily, and is contained
    in comma-separated-values files (.csv files).  Many modern programming languages,
    including R and Python, have libraries or packages that interface well with 
    .csv files, making it a breeze to ingest, manipulate, and analyze the data 
    within!
