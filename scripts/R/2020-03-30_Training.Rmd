# March 30, 2020
Hello, and welcome to a summary the first training session for bio-group technical
development!  This is an Rmarkdown document that will walk you through what we 
did in the first session on March 30, 2020.

With the myriad statistics of the novel coronavirus pervading most media outlets, 
we opted to examine the data ourselves to obtain a clearer understanding of the 
spread of the disease.  We opted to use the dataset maintained bythe Johns Hopkins 
University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE), for two main
reasons:

    1) They maintain a most excellent data dashboard located here: 
    (https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6) 
    Of particular interest to us is the spatial location data, meaning that we too
    can generate our own maps from these data.  Thanks to Kelsey for the original 
    share!
    
    2) The entire dataset is conveniently located on github 
    (https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19), updated daily, and is entirely 
    contained within comma-separated-values files (.csv files).  Many modern 
    programming languages,including R and Python, have libraries or packages that 
    interface well with .csv files, making it a breeze to ingest, manipulate, and 
    analyze the data within!
    
In the code below, we will walk through the initial setup of this project, which
includes dowloading, cleaning, and organizing the data, and we will finish by
generating a plot of the daily mortality rate in the U.S. as well as the total 
to-date U.S. mortality count.  This document is in a format known as an "R Markdown",
which allows us to easily run each code chunk one at a time.  The code is 
organized so that we may easily adapt and expand upon it to answer other questions 
of interest, which so far have includued adding country population counts to the 
dataset and generating animated heatmaps of infections/deaths/recoveries over time.  
Together, hopefully we will create some meaning from this unique situation and 
grow our knowledge and skillsets to better ourselves and our communities!

## Libraries
At the top of any script we write, first we include all the libraries used in this
analysis.   These "libraries" are packages of code that we import to our script 
so we may use some of their handy features.  For example, the "xml2" library allows
us to download a webpage and extract all of the text from it in just a few simple
lines of code!  A few commonly used libraries include data.table, dplyr, and 
magrittr, all of which we will go into later.
```{r libraries}
library(magrittr)
library(xml2)
library(lubridate)
library(data.table)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```


## Set paths
This line is purely procedural.  Here we tell R in a platform-agnostic way where 
to put on your computer the downloaded csv data as well as the R scripts.  In 
other words, R makes a guess at where your home directory is, regardless of whether
you are using Windows, MacOS, or Linux.
```{r set-paths}
git.path <- Sys.getenv('HOME')  # Where the base COVID19-Data-Exploration folder lives.
```


## Fetching the CSV data from Github
Here's where we start to get our hands dirty.  In the 3 code chunks below, we 
first download the Github webpage that has all of the csv files in it and extract 
the text (*scrape-webpage*).  Second, we look through all of that text for any
string of characters in the date format YYYY-MM-DD, since that is the naming 
convention for all of the csv files, and make a list of those dates (*parse-dates*).  
Finally, we use the list of dates (corresponding to the names of the csv files)
to download the raw comma-separated data and save it locally to our computer 
(*fetch-data*).

```{r scrape-webpage}
# Pull in list of daily data. 
xml.path <- 'https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_daily_reports'
report.file <- download_html(xml.path)
html.read <- read_html(report.file)
csv.list <- xml_text(html.read) %>% strsplit(split='\\n') %>% unlist
```

```{r parse-dates}
# Parse html for the csv names
dates.list <- lapply(csv.list, function(x) {
    if (grepl(pattern='.csv', x, fixed=TRUE)) { 
        regex <- regexpr('\\d{2}-\\d{2}-\\d{4}.csv', x)
        return(substr(x, start=regex[[1]], stop=regex[[1]]+attr(regex, 'match.length')))
    }
})
dates.list[sapply(dates.list, is.null)] <- NULL
dates.list <- dates.list
```

```{r fetch-data}
# Fetch raw csv data
raw.path <- 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_daily_reports/'
suppress <- lapply(dates.list, function(x, raw.path) {
    download.file(paste0(raw.path, x), paste0(git.path,'/Code/COVID19-Data-Exploration/data/',x))
}, raw.path)
```


# trim whitespace and any trailing digits
trim<- function(x) return(tstrsplit(x, "\\s|[A-Z]", keep=1) %>%unlist)

# x <- dates.list[[1]]
data.dt <- lapply(dates.list, function(x) {
    
    # Fix column names and standardize date formats
    tmp.dt <- fread(paste0(git.path,'/Code/COVID19-Data-Exploration/data/',x)) %>% data.table
    colnames(tmp.dt) <- colnames(tmp.dt) %>% gsub('[ \\/]', '_', .)  # sub spaces and slashes for underscore
    # Fix date formatting for first 10 days
    tryCatch({
        tmp.dt$Last_Update <- tmp.dt$Last_Update %>% 
            trim %>% 
            parse_date_time(orders=c('%m/%d/%y','%m/%d/%Y','%Y-%m-%d'))
        return(tmp.dt)},
        warning = function(w) {
            message(paste('Warning!  Check file:', x))
        },
        error = function(e) {
            message(paste('Error!  Check file', x))
        }
    )
}) %>% rbindlist(fill=TRUE)

data.dt[data.dt$Deaths%>%is.na, 'Deaths'] <- 0
us_deaths.dt <- data.dt[data.dt$Country_Region=='US',] %>% group_by(Last_Update) %>% summarize(Daily_Deaths=max(Deaths)) %>% data.table
us_deaths.dt$Cumulative_Deaths <- cumsum(us_deaths.dt$Daily_Deaths)
sum(us_deaths.dt$Daily_Deaths)

melted.dt <- melt(us_deaths.dt, id.vars='Last_Update', variable.name = 'Deaths')

ggplot(melted.dt, aes(x=Last_Update, y=value)) +
    geom_point() + 
    geom_line() + 
    facet_wrap('Deaths')
